My Rust solutions to various programming puzzles, including [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) and [2021 Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).

Benchmark with `cargo bench`. Run with `cargo run -- [--euler] [--aoc] <problem-num>`.

This makes heavy use of experimental nightly APIs, because being on the bleeding edge is cool or something.

If you want to use code (not sure why you would), it's MIT-licensed. But I encourage you to solve these problems on your own, they're really fun.
